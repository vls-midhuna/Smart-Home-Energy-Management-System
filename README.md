# Smart Home Energy Management System
## Introduction
Energy consumption in homes often leads to high utility bills and increased environmental impact due to inefficient usage. Many homeowners lack real-time insights into their electricity consumption, making it difficult to take proactive steps toward energy efficiency. Without proper monitoring and control, excessive energy use results in unnecessary expenses and contributes to carbon emissions, highlighting the need for a smarter approach to home energy management.

The Smart Home Energy Management System offers a real-time solution to this challenge by providing users with data-driven insights, automated alerts, and energy-saving recommendations. By leveraging advanced monitoring and analytics, the system helps homeowners track their energy usage, identify inefficiencies, and optimize consumption patterns. Through a user-friendly mobile app and web dashboard, users can make informed decisions, reduce electricity costs, and contribute to a more sustainable future.
